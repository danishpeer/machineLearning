# Machine Learning Playground

Welcome to my Machine Learning Playground! ðŸš€. Here, I dive deep into the inner workings of algorithms, experiment with different approaches, and document my learnings along the way.

## About This Repository

This repository serves as a collection of my implementations of popular machine learning algorithms from scratch, providing a hands-on learning experience for both myself and others interested in diving into the world of machine learning.

## What's Inside and Next?

Within this repository, you'll find my implementations of numerous machine learning algorithms, all crafted with curiosity. From simple linear regression to sophisticated deep learning models, each algorithm represents a stepping stone in my journey towards mastery.


### Algorithms Planning to Explore:

- Perceptron
- Adaline
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- K-Means Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- LLM
- and more...


### How to Explore

Feel free to delve into the directories, explore the code, and gain insights into how each algorithm operates. I've included Jupyter Notebooks for visualization and experimentation, allowing me to deepen my understanding and share my insights with others.

## Next Steps

As I continue to explore the vast landscape of machine learning, I aim to expand this repository further. Whether it's refining existing implementations, delving into new algorithms, or tackling real-world projects, this repository will serve as a living record of my growth and accomplishments in the field.
